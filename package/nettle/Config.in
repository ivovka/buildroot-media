          Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit
          easily in more or less any context: In crypto toolkits for
          object-oriented languages (C++, Python, Pike, ...), in
          applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel space.
          In most contexts, you need more than the basic
          cryptographic algorithms, you also need some way to keep
          track of available algorithms, their properties and variants.
          You often have some algorithm selection process, often
          dictated by a protocol you want to implement.
