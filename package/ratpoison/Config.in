          Ratpoison is a simple window manager with no large library dependencies,
          no fancy graphics, no window decorations, and no rodent dependence.
          It is largely modeled after GNU Screen, which has done wonders in the
          virtual terminal market. All interaction with the window manager is done
          through keystrokes. Ratpoison has a prefix map to minimize the key
          clobbering that cripples EMACS and other quality pieces of software.
          All windows are maximized and kept maximized to avoid wasting precious
          screen space
