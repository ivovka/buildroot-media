            The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW) is a cross-platform C/C++ extension loading library.
            GLEW provides efficient run-time mechanisms for determining which OpenGL extensions are supported
            on the target platform. OpenGL core and extension functionality is exposed in a single header file.
