          zip is a compression and file packaging utility for Unix,
          VMS, MSDOS, OS/2, Windows 9x/NT/XP, Minix, Atari, Macintosh,
          MVS, z/OS, Amiga, Acorn RISC, and other OS.
          It is analogous to a combination of the Unix commands tar(1)
          and compress(1) (or tar(1) and gzip(1)) and is compatible
          with PKZIP (Phil Katz's ZIP for MSDOS systems) and other
          major zip utilities.
