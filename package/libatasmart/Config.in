            libatasmart is a lean, small and clean implementation of an ATA S.M.A.R.T.
            reading and parsing library. It's fairly comprehensive, however I only support
            a subset of the full S.M.A.R.T. set of functions:
            those parts which made sense to me, not the esoteric stuff.
