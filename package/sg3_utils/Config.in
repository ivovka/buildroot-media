          sg3_utils is a package of utilities for accessing devices that use SCSI command sets.
          Most utilities issue a single command and display the response, while some work at a
          slightly higher level. There are utilities for fetching INQUIRY data and VPD, mode,
          and log pages. There is support for modern SCSI transports such as SAS and FCP.
