          Bc is an arbitrary precision numeric processing language.
          Syntax is similar to C, but differs in many substantial areas.
          It supports interactive execution of statements. Bc is a utility included
          in the POSIX P1003.2/D11 draft standard. Since the POSIX document does not
          specify how bc must be implemented, this version does not use the historical
          method of having bc be a compiler for the dc calculator. This version has a
          single executable that both compiles the language and runs the resulting
          'byte code'. The byte code is not the dc language.
